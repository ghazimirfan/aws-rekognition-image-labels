# aws-rekognition-image-labels
Image Labels Generator using AWS Rekognition, S3, and Python

This project demonstrates how to use Amazon Rekognition with an image stored in Amazon S3 to detect objects, scenes, and concepts.  
The results include confidence scores and bounding boxes drawn on the image.

---

Architecture Workflow:
1. Upload an image to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. Amazon Rekognition analyzes the image and detects labels.
3. A Python script (`detect_labels.py`) fetches the results using boto3.
4. Labels + bounding boxes are displayed using Matplotlib.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aws-rekognition-image-labels.git
cd aws-rekognition-image-labels

2. Install dependencies

Install Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you also want AWS CLI + Jupyter for testing/documentation:

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

3. Configure AWS credentials

Make sure you have AWS CLI configured with valid credentials:

aws configure


Provide your:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region (e.g., us-east-1)

Output format (e.g., json)

4. Create an S3 bucket & upload an image

Create a new S3 bucket in your AWS account.

Upload an image (e.g., test_image.jpg).

Update detect_labels.py with your bucket name and image file.

photo = 'test_image.jpg'
bucket = 'your-bucket-name'

5. Run the script
python detect_labels.py
